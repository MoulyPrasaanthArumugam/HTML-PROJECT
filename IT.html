    <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            It Chapter Two is a 2019 American supernatural horror film and a sequel to the 2017 film It, both based on the 1986 novel by Stephen King. The film is directed by Andy Muschietti, returning from the first film, with a screenplay by Gary Dauberman. Set in 2016, 27 years after the events of the first film, it stars Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, Andy Bean, and Bill Skarsg√•rd, who returns as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. It is the second installment of the It film series and centers on the Losers Club reuniting from their various lives apart from each other to destroy It once and for all, though being apart means they have mostly forgotten the terror they endured together 27 years ago.
