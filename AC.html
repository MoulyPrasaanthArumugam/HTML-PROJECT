    <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            More than 3000 years in the future, society has been transformed by new technology,
             leading to human bodies being interchangeable and death no longer being permanent.
              Takeshi Kovacs is the only surviving soldier of a group of elite interstellar warriors
               who were defeated in an uprising against the new world order. His mind was imprisoned
                for centuries until impossibly wealthy businessman Laurens Bancroft offers him the chance
                 to live again. Kovacs will have to do something for Bancroft, though, if he wants to be
                  resurrected. Bancroft's request of Kovacs is to solve a murder -- Bancroft's.
                   "Altered Carbon" is based on Richard K. Morgan's cyberpunk noir novel of the same name.
