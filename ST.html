    <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            It's the fall of 1984, about a year after Will Byers was found,
            and he has been plagued by seeing visions of the Upside Down featuring a more dangerous monster. 
            That leads the boy to see a suspiciously friendly new doctor, with the possibility that Will's 
            visions are the result of suffering from PTSD. Nancy deals with survivor's remorse over the death 
            of best friend Barb. Meanwhile, a new sinister entity threatens the Hawkins residents who survived
            the year-earlier events. New to the town is tomboy Max, who befriends the boys and attracts the
            romantic interests of Dustin and Lucas.
